# Artemis Financial Secure Software Report

## Client Summary

### Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a company in the financial services sector. They needed a detailed review of their software to identify and fix any security vulnerabilities. Their goal was to ensure that their software was secure enough to protect sensitive client data and meet industry security standards.

### What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities?
I was thorough in identifying and documenting the security weaknesses in their software. I provided clear, actionable steps for addressing each issue. Ensuring secure code is crucial because it helps prevent unauthorized access and data breaches, protecting both the company and its clients. Secure software strengthens trust, maintains the company’s reputation, and prevents potential financial and legal problems.

### Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
Writing secure code is essential because it guards against unauthorized access and data breaches. It maintains the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information, which enhances the company's reputation and builds client trust. Secure software also helps the company avoid potential financial losses and legal issues related to data breaches.

### Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The toughest part was finding the more subtle vulnerabilities that required a deep dive into the software’s architecture. This challenge was also a valuable learning experience, as it sharpened my skills in using security assessment tools and performing detailed code reviews.

### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I added extra layers of security by implementing multi-factor authentication, encrypting sensitive data, and conducting regular security audits. Moving forward, I would use a mix of automated tools (like OWASP ZAP) and manual code reviews to find vulnerabilities and decide on the best mitigation techniques based on the severity of the risks.

### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensured the software’s functionality and security by performing comprehensive testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and security tests. After refactoring the code, I re-ran all the tests and used static analysis tools to check if any new vulnerabilities had been introduced.

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I utilized tools like OWASP ZAP for scanning vulnerabilities, SonarQube for analyzing code quality, and GitHub for version control. Adopting secure coding practices, such as input validation and proper error handling, will be beneficial in future projects.

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
From this assignment, I can demonstrate my ability to conduct thorough security assessments, identify and fix software vulnerabilities, and apply best practices for secure coding. The detailed reports and secure codebase from this project are exemplary of my capabilities in software security.
